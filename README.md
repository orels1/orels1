👋 Heyo, I'm Anton (orels1) and I mostly write utilitarian stuff: from tiny [mock servers](https://github.com/orels1/puremock) to [API clients](https://github.com/orels1/rawger) and [status pages](https://orels1/statusreport).

🎮 Lately I've been drifting towards Unity Editor Tools and Shader development, though. If you do any VRChat Udon development - [check out UdonToolkit](https://github.com/orels1/UdonToolkit), as well as my assorted [Editor Scripts](https://github.com/orels1/orels1-Unity-Scripts) and [Shaders](https://github.com/orels1/orels1-Unity-Shaders)

🎨 Some of more artsy stuff I do is available on [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/orels1)

🤖 If you're into discord bots, you might also know another project of mine - [cogs.red](https://cogs.red), which I made and used to maintain for the lovely community at [Red](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot). Altho these days I had to detach from that project due to [a bunch of reasons](https://orels.sh/whats-up-with-cogs-red), which I am incredibly sad about, but it is how it is.

💬 If you like what I do - feel free to drop by my [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/fR869XP) or even check out the [Patreon page](https://patreon.com/orels1)!

❤ Hope you have a great day ❤
